## Introduction

Artemis is my multi purpose bot. It used to do much more but I decided to trim the fat. Now it has a few commands and can react. It actually is connected to [Shapes](https://shapes.inc/) which enables it to interact with people with AI generated responses.

## Commands

- `/fix`: Fixes the embeding of a given link. Works with Twitter, TikTok and Instagram.
- `/quote`: Sends a random quote.
- `/shame`: Sends a random image to a given user.

## Reactions

If a message contains a certain trigger word from a stored list, there is a one in three chance it will react to the message.

## ~~Game (Tales of Murwelgrave)~~(Not ported yet)

~~An RPG style game where the player gets to engage randomly generated monsters. As they do, a battle will ensue, if they win their stats will go up and will be stored into the database. There are also achievements to be gained.~~
